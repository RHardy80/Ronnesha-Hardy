# Ronnesha-Hardy
Hi! I'm currently transitioning into the field of Business Analytics, driven by a strong interest in data, strategy, and decision-making. I'm currently completing a Business Analytics Bootcamp where I'm gaining hands-on experience with tools like Excel, SQL, Tableau, and Python for data analysis.

While I may be new to this field, I'm deeply committed to building practical skills and growing my portfolio through real-world projects. I‚Äôm passionate about turning data into insights that drive smarter business decisions.

üîç Currently learning:

Data visualization with Tableau
SQL for data querying
Python for data analysis
Business problem-solving with data
üìä Looking forward to:

Collaborating on data-driven projects
Contributing to open-source analytics tools
Connecting with others in the analytics & data community

Some fun facts:
-I've probably watched all of the seasons of Bob Burgers at least 10 times. My favorite character is Louise.
-As I have gotten older I have found my self enjoy reading any Marvel comic and most recently Invicible when I'm winding down for the night.
-I have a love hate relationship with working out but if I'm going to pick any kind of cardio it has to be step aerobics or dancing. 
-My goal for 2025 is to land my dream job in data.
